Features:

 * **Build projects:** wraps [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) with a pipeline to build libraries, tools, & APIs.
 * **Lint projects:** wraps [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) with strict, non-configurable defaults (and bumps performance).
 * **Test projects:** wraps [jest](http://github.com/facebook/jest) with dynamic defaults.
 * **Benchmark projects:** provides a simple benchmark runner.
 * **Profile projects:** provides an instrumentation-based CPU profiler to isolate bottlenecks.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply install `@karimsa/wiz` as a devDependency into your project. The CLI can be called using the `wiz` command.
Help information is baked into all sub-commands via the `--help` flag. Documentation is being worked on.
